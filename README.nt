In order to run YapOr with teams MPI should be installed (we recommend OpenMPI) and then proceed in the following way:

- create a new directory (for example bin) in the same directory where the folder of the Yap source code is located.
- run the following commands inside the new directory:
  - ../yap-6.3/configure --prefix=$PWD --enable-or-parallelism=copy --with-mpi --enable-tabling=no
  - make depend
  - make
  - make install
- at this point yap its compiled so we may run the comand ./yap -l name_of_the_example_to_be_run.pl in order to execute yap with one of the 10 benchmarks available. We assume that the directory of the benchmarks is on the $PATH variable, a simple way to do this is to copy the benchmark files to the directory where the yap binary is located.    
- once the file is loaded, if you want to measure the time elapsed we should execute the time_query on the other hand if we want to see the answers we run the debug_query.
